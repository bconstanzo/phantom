__version__ = "0.6"  # removed unstable because it gave trouble with PyPI
# "unstable" here means we're working towards stabilizing the namespaces and API
# of the project to 0.6. For every step towards reaching that goal, we'll update
# the micro number until we can jump to 0.6 and everything has been ordered to
# the new conventions.
